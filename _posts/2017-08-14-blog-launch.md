This is my third attempt at launching this site, and I think this is it. I still need to create content for currently dead end links and adjust the layout after seeing how this post will turn out, but this is really it. Welcome to my first blog!

My purpose for this *experiment* is to keep track of what I learn, lab skills for now and, eventually, important discoveries in biomedical sciences. To achieve this, for the rest of the summer, I am setting a goal to read at least two published journal articles a week. Without skipping the materials and methods sections. Just as developing a routine in the lab has helped me feel more comfortable performing tasks and assays, setting up a routine for reading scientific literature should allow greater clarity as I hone in on what I truly want to study.

So I've laid out the "what" and "why" of this blog, but what about the "how"? I'll need to think about that one for awhile, but I'm excited to see how my ideas and thoughts progress along the way!
