Last week, I gained a better perspective on experimental design and the importance of controls in setups to account for variable elements (areas to focus on when troubleshooting). A research scientist in my lab walked me through the process of creating dilution curves to determine an appropriate sample dilution for use in experiments. To prepare her ELISAs*, she always performed all the calculations of all the reagent amounts she'd need beforehand, doublechecking her work the second day as well. These calculations included converting protein/antibody concentrations into working concentrations and determining solute concentrations for buffers. Going through her protocols, I learned how to do all these while occasionally running into my long-time issue with decimal places.

Conceptually, I learned about monoclonal vs. polyclonal antibodies, and the different types of ELISA setups: direct, indirect, and sandwich. Using which type of antibody and assay depended on the results you hope to see. Furtherfore, is it a yes-or-no question you're asking or do you want to quantify some analyte(s)? My mentor used them for both cases, but mostly to generate read amounts that would be transferred as a standard curve on Prism for analysis. 

So it was an eventful week, and I felt like practicing molecular biology techniques and lab calculations while knowing what purpose the experiments would serve toward a bigger picture or discovery made the learning process quicker and less grueling. Except serial dilutions. I am totally convinced they're designed to scare undergrads from pursuing research entirely.
